# Cordova + A-Frame + Rollup

This demo shows the A-Frame "Hello WebVR" demo working in Cordova.

Status: Working, requires A-Frame build from https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/4452

## Notes

- MUST be run from a physical device. Simulator is very slow and does not yield a usable experience.
